yew - rust - wasm, just notes i'm taking from the primeagen

wasm - write languages for the web. deliver the software to the end user.

wasm it is a compile target and it's pretty interesting.
apparently figma is built on wasm as well that's interesting as fuck.

I have a feeling i'm going to re-write my code for my personal blog all the time.
